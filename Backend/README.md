# Project Title: List of Times you Were Betrayed by Your Water Bottle

## Idea:
This project explores the humorous and frustrating moments when your water bottle lets you down in the most inconvenient ways. Whether it leaks, gets stuck, or refuses to open, these betrayals can bring a little bit of chaos to your day. The project aims to compile a collection of relatable and funny scenarios where your water bottle is the villain.

## Features:
- A list of humorous and exaggerated scenarios where the water bottle "betrays" you.
- Categories of betrayal such as "Leak Failures," "The Lid That Won't Budge," "Spilling in the Bag," and "Too Cold, Too Hot."
- Interactive elements allowing users to add their own "betrayal" moments.
- Shareable content, so users can send their most epic water bottle betrayals to friends.
- A possible option to create a 'Betrayal Counter' to keep track of how many times you've been betrayed by your water bottle.

## Goal:
The goal of this project is to bring some fun and lightheartedness to everyday annoyances, showcasing the 'betrayal' of something as simple as a water bottle. It's meant to make you laugh while reflecting on those minor daily struggles that everyone can relate to.
